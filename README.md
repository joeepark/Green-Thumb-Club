# Green Thumb Club
Green Thumb Club is a passion project of mine. Coming from an e-commerce background I wanted to have fun creating my own e-commerce platform where users can easily buy and sell their plant collection online. I am currently going through iterations of this project and I plan to create a finished project soon.
